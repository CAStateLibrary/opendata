## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this reference book is to lay out a path for California agencies and departments that want to begin publishing their data in a more open and accessible format. By sharing the experiences and lessons learned from the efforts of two early-adopters—the State Controllers Office and The California Health and Human Services Agency—others will have a better idea of how to achieve their own goals and priorities for their open data projects.

This work is intended to act as a resource, reviewing the key issues surrounding the release of open data, such as guidance on establishing a governance team, a brief overview of key regulations and policies departments need to know, with special attention to balancing privacy and confidentiaity with the need for openness and transparency.

### Open Data Definition

When trying to define open data, it helps to think about government data as existing on a spectrum. The simple act of publishing data can help inform the public about the conduct of public business. For this goal, it’s is only needed to publish the data alongside necessary narrative to provide context so the public can understand what the data says. It is not necessary, however, to include the level of detail or additional information for the public to use the data for further purpose. For this reason, we refer to examples on this end of the spectrum as transparency data. 

Open data requires something more. The general consensus is that—at minimum—open data must be published without constraints to further public use. To achieve this, the data must be published to be:

* Machine readable,
* Formatted according to widely- used, open standards,
* Include descriptive metadata,
* Free from licensing restrictions.

Even this definition of open data describes the bare minimum. One limitation of open data is that it is often published under the assumption that the users of the data are made up of mostly of outside experts, such as private businesses, researchers, or members of the civic tech community. This effectively excludes large swathes of the public that have an equal right to access and use such data. Publishers of open government data must consider if their definition of open data is inclusive. Data can be made more accessible and inclusive by:
* Including APIs that allow smaller developers to efficiently build apps and tools with the data,
* Including analysis and visualization tools, so non-experts can interact with the data in a meaningful way,
* Publishing the data and associated metadata in languages other than English, so non-native speakers can fully utilize the data as well.

Publishing data for transparency itself is a laudable goal; however, government agencies will see even greater engagement and involvement of the public in achieving their core missions as they publish further along the spectrum towards truly open data.
