The purpose of this reference book is to lay out a path for California agencies and departments that want to begin publishing their data in a more open and accessible format. By sharing the experiences and lessons learned from the efforts of two early-adopters—the State Controllers Office and The California Health and Human Services Agency—others will have a better idea of how to achieve their own goals and priorities for their open data projects.

This work is intended to act as a resource, reviewing the key issues surrounding the release of open data, such as guidance on establishing a governance team, a brief overview of key regulations and policies departments need to know, with special attention to balancing privacy and confidentiaity with the need for openness and transparency.
