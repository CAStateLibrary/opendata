title: Open Data in California
---

The purpose of this reference book is to lay out a path for California agencies and departments that want to begin publishing their data in a more open and accessible format. By sharing the experiences and lessons learned from the efforts of two early-adopters—the State Controllers Office and The California Health and Human Services Agency—others will have a better idea of how to achieve their own goals and priorities for their open data projects.

This work is intended to act as a resource, reviewing the key issues surrounding the release of open data, such as guidance on establishing a governance team, a brief overview of key regulations and policies departments need to know, with special attention to balancing privacy and confidentiaity with the need for openness and transparency.

### Open Data Definition

When trying to define open data, it helps to think about government data as existing on a spectrum. The simple act of publishing data can help inform the public about the conduct of public business. For this goal, it’s is only needed to publish the data alongside necessary narrative to provide context so the public can understand what the data says. It is not necessary, however, to include the level of detail or additional information for the public to use the data for further purpose. For this reason, we refer to examples on this end of the spectrum as transparency data.

Open data requires more than just transparency. The general consensus is that—at minimum—open data must be published without constraints to further public use. To achieve this, the data should be:

*	Machine readable,
*	Formatted according to widely- used, open standards,
*	Include descriptive metadata,
*	Free from licensing restrictions.

Agencies can do more, however, to make their data as inclusive as possible. Open data is often published under the assumption that the users are made up of mostly of outside experts, such as private businesses, researchers, or members of the civic tech community. But, this can make it difficult for non-technical users to leverage the benefits of open data. Agencies can make their data more accessible and inclusive by:

*	Building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to efficiently build applications and tools with the data,
*	Including analysis and visualization tools, so non-experts can interact with the data in a meaningful way,
*	Publishing the data and associated metadata in languages other than English, so non-native speakers can fully utilize the data as well.

Open data does not have a one-size-fits-all definition. As Agencies consider publishing open data, it is important to adopt a definition that meets their needs and those of their audiences.
